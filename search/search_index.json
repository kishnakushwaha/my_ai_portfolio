The Sigmoid Function Unlike Linear Regression which outputs continuous values, Logistic Regression transforms the output using the Sigmoid function: $$S(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$$ Code Example Here is how I implemented it in Python: ```python import numpy as np def sigmoid(x): return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x)) x = np.array([1, 2, 3]) print(sigmoid(x))","title":"Understanding Logistic Regression"},{"location":"assets/blog/logistic-regression/#understanding-logistic-regression","text":"Date: December 18, 2025 Classification is one of the most fundamental tasks in Machine Learning.

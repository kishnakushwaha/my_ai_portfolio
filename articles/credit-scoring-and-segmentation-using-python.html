<p>Credit scoring and segmentation refer to the process of evaluating the creditworthiness of individuals or businesses and dividing them into distinct groups based on their credit profiles. It aims to assess the likelihood of borrowers repaying their debts and helps financial institutions make informed decisions regarding lending and managing credit risk. If you want to learn how to calculate credit scores and segment customers based on their credit scores, this article is for you. In this article, I will take you through the task of Credit Scoring and Segmentation using <strong><a href="roadmap-to-learn-python.html" target="">Python</a></strong>.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Credit Scoring and Segmentation: Overview</h2>
<p>The process of calculating credit scores and segmenting customers based on their credit scores involves several steps. Firstly, relevant data about borrowers, such as payment history, credit utilization, credit history, and credit mix, is collected and organized. Then, using complex algorithms and statistical models, the collected data is analyzed to generate credit scores for each borrower.</p>
<p>These credit scores are numerical representations of the borrower’s creditworthiness and indicate the likelihood of default or timely repayment. Once the credit scores are calculated, customers are segmented into different risk categories or credit tiers based on predefined thresholds.</p>
<p>This segmentation helps financial institutions assess the credit risk associated with each customer and make informed decisions regarding loan approvals, interest rates, and credit limits. By categorizing customers into segments, financial institutions can better manage their lending portfolios and effectively mitigate the risk of potential defaults.</p>
<p>So to get started with the task of credit scoring and segmentation, we first need to have appropriate data. I found an ideal dataset for this task. You can download the dataset from <a href="https://statso.io/credit-scoring-case-study/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Credit Scoring and Segmentation using Python</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Calculating Credit Scores</h2>
<p>The dataset doesn’t have any feature representing the credit scores of individuals. To calculate the credit scores, we need to use an appropriate technique. There are several widely used techniques for calculating credit scores, each with its own calculation process. One example is the FICO score, a commonly used credit scoring model in the industry.</p>
<p>Below is how we can implement the FICO score method to calculate credit scores:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Define the mapping for categorical features
education_level_mapping = {'High School': 1, 'Bachelor': 2, 'Master': 3, 'PhD': 4}
employment_status_mapping = {'Unemployed': 0, 'Employed': 1, 'Self-Employed': 2}

# Apply mapping to categorical features
data['Education Level'] = data['Education Level'].map(education_level_mapping)
data['Employment Status'] = data['Employment Status'].map(employment_status_mapping)

# Calculate credit scores using the complete FICO formula
credit_scores = []

for index, row in data.iterrows():
    payment_history = row['Payment History']
    credit_utilization_ratio = row['Credit Utilization Ratio']
    number_of_credit_accounts = row['Number of Credit Accounts']
    education_level = row['Education Level']
    employment_status = row['Employment Status']

    # Apply the FICO formula to calculate the credit score
    credit_score = (payment_history * 0.35) + (credit_utilization_ratio * 0.30) + (number_of_credit_accounts * 0.15) + (education_level * 0.10) + (employment_status * 0.10)
    credit_scores.append(credit_score)

# Add the credit scores as a new column to the DataFrame
data['Credit Score'] = credit_scores

print(data.head())</code></pre>

<p>Below is how the above code works:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Firstly, it defines mappings for two categorical features: “Education Level” and “Employment Status”. The “Education Level” mapping assigns numerical values to different levels of education, such as “High School” being mapped to 1, “Bachelor” to 2, “Master” to 3, and “PhD” to 4. The “Employment Status” mapping assigns numerical values to different employment statuses, such as “Unemployed” being mapped to 0, “Employed” to 1, and “Self-Employed” to 2.</li>
<li>Next, the code applies the defined mappings to the corresponding columns in the DataFrame. It transforms the values of the “Education Level” and “Employment Status” columns from their original categorical form to the mapped numerical representations.</li>
<li>After that, the code initiates an iteration over each row of the DataFrame to calculate the credit scores for each individual. It retrieves the values of relevant features, such as “Payment History”, “Credit Utilization Ratio”, “Number of Credit Accounts”, “Education Level”, and “Employment Status”, from each row.</li>
</ol>
<p>Within the iteration, the FICO formula is applied to calculate the credit score for each individual. The formula incorporates the weighted values of the features mentioned earlier: </p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>35% weight for “Payment History”, </li>
<li>30% weight for “Credit Utilization Ratio”, </li>
<li>15% weight for “Number of Credit Accounts”, </li>
<li>10% weight for “Education Level”, </li>
<li>and 10% weight for “Employment Status”. </li>
</ol>
<p>The calculated credit score is then stored in a list called “credit_scores”.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Segmentation Based on Credit Scores</h2>
<p>Now, let’s use the KMeans clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their credit scores:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

X = data[['Credit Score']]
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, n_init=10, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(X)
data['Segment'] = kmeans.labels_</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s have a look at the segments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Convert the 'Segment' column to category data type
data['Segment'] = data['Segment'].astype('category')

<p>Now let’s name the segments based on the above clusters and have a look at the segments again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">data['Segment'] = data['Segment'].map({2: 'Very Low', 
                                       0: 'Low',
                                       1: 'Good',
                                       3: "Excellent"})

# Convert the 'Segment' column to category data type
data['Segment'] = data['Segment'].astype('category')

# Visualize the segments using Plotly
fig = px.scatter(data, x=data.index, y='Credit Score', color='Segment',
                 color_discrete_sequence=['green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'red'])
fig.update_layout(
    xaxis_title='Customer Index',
    yaxis_title='Credit Score',
    title='Customer Segmentation based on Credit Scores'
)
fig.show()</code></pre>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Credit Scoring and Segmentation" class="wp-image-20741" data-attachment-id="20741" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-caption="" data-image-description="" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="credit-score-5" data-orig-size="857,525" data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" height="525" loading="lazy" sizes="auto, (max-width: 857px) 100vw, 857px" src="../assets/datasets/credit-score-5.png" width="857"/></figure>
<p>So this is how you can perform credit scoring and segmentation using Python.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Summary</h3>
<p>Credit scoring and segmentation refer to the process of evaluating the creditworthiness of individuals or businesses and dividing them into distinct groups based on their credit profiles. It aims to assess the likelihood of borrowers repaying their debts and helps financial institutions make informed decisions regarding lending and managing credit risk.
